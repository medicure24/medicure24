                        <p><b>What is a Brain Stroke?</b><br>
                            A brain stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die within minutes.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Types of Brain Strokes:</b><br>

                                <li><b>Ischemic Stroke:</b> Occurs when a blood clot blocks or narrows an artery leading to the brain. This is the most common type of stroke.</li>
                                <li><b>Hemorrhagic Stroke:</b> Occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing bleeding inside or around brain tissue.</li>
                                <li><b>Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):</b> Often called a mini-stroke, it is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke. A TIA doesn’t cause permanent damage and is a warning sign of a future stroke.</li>
                            </ul>
